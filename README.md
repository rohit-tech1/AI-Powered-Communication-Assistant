# AI-Powered Communication Assistant

## Introduction

**AI-Powered Communication Assistant** helps businesses automatically process incoming customer emails. It saves time by analyzing tone (sentiment), deciding how urgent the email is, and creating an AI-generated draft reply.

## Tech Stack

* **Backend:** Node.js, Express
* **Database:** MongoDB
* **AI:** OpenAI GPT
* **Others:** Mongoose, Axios, Dotenv

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/rohit-tech1/AI-Powered-Communication-Assistant.git
```

2. Navigate into the project folder:

```bash
cd backend
```

3. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

4. Create a `.env` file with the following variables:

```
MONGO_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key
PORT=5000
```

5. Start the server:

```bash
npm run start
```

## Architecture

**Backend (Express API):** Provides REST endpoints for creating, fetching, and processing emails.

**Database (MongoDB):** Stores all email details and analysis results for retrieval.

**AI Layer (OpenAI):** Generates intelligent draft replies based on customer messages.

**Data Flow:**

1. A user (via Thunder Client/Postman) sends email details to the API.
2. Express stores the email in MongoDB.
3. When `/process` is called → Sentiment & Priority are analyzed.
4. OpenAI generates a draft reply.
5. Updated email (with sentiment, priority, draft) is saved back in MongoDB.

## Approach Used

* **Sentiment Analysis (rule-based):** Detects tone as positive, negative, or neutral.
* **Priority Detection (rule-based):** Identifies urgency using keywords.
* **Draft Reply Generation (AI-powered):** OpenAI GPT creates professional customer support reply.
* **Integration:** MongoDB stores emails with sentiment, priority, and draft reply.

## Key Endpoints

* `POST /api/emails` → Add a new email (`{from, subject, body}`)
* `GET /api/emails` → Get all stored emails
* `GET /api/emails/:id` → Get specific email by ID
* `POST /api/emails/:id/process` → Run analysis & generate AI draft reply

## Future Improvements

### 1. Replace rule-based sentiment with a trained NLP model

* **Why:** Rule-based checks miss nuanced sentiment (sarcasm, mixed sentiment).
* **How:** Train or fine-tune a transformer (e.g., DistilRoBERTa or BERT) on customer-support sentiment data, or use an off-the-shelf Hugging Face sentiment model. Serve via FastAPI/serverless function. Cache results for repeated messages.
* **Success metrics:** sentiment classification accuracy, F1-score improvements, fewer false positives/negatives.

### 2. Implement RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) for factual replies

* **Why:** LLM-generated replies are more accurate with KB/article references.
* **How:** Build a pipeline: (a) extract embeddings for KB docs and incoming emails, (b) store vectors in a vector DB (Pinecone, Milvus, Weaviate, FAISS), (c) retrieve top-k docs at runtime, include them in the LLM prompt with attribution. Use prompt templates for clarity.
* **Success metrics:** decreased follow-up rate, higher first-contact resolution, improved factual accuracy.

### 3. Add ingestion pipeline for real mailboxes (IMAP/Gmail/Outlook)

* **Why:** Manual POSTs are fine for demos; production needs automatic ingestion.
* **How:** Worker that polls IMAP or Gmail API webhook, normalizes content, deduplicates, inserts into DB. Use OAuth2.
* **Success metrics:** reliable ingestion (zero duplicate loss), latency < X minutes.

### 4. Move processing to asynchronous workers + priority queue

* **Why:** Reply generation and API calls are I/O bound.
* **How:** Redis + BullMQ (or RabbitMQ/Kafka) to queue jobs. Prioritize urgent emails, run concurrency-limited workers, implement retries/backoff. Persist job status & metrics.
* **Success metrics:** stable API latency, predictable throughput, urgent email SLA.

### 5. Human-in-the-loop UI & feedback loop

* **Why:** Agents review/edit drafts; feedback improves future responses.
* **How:** Dashboard to view inbox, edit draft, send reply, provide feedback (accept/reject/modify). Log edits to training dataset. Periodically fine-tune models or update prompts.
* **Success metrics:** decreasing agent edit rate, CSAT improvements.

### 6. Observability, logging & alerting

* **Why:** Production systems need monitoring for failures, latency, cost spikes.
* **How:** Structured logging (JSON), Sentry for errors, Prometheus + Grafana for metrics, alerts for SLA breaches/error rates.
* **Success metrics:** actionable alerts, reduced MTTR, predictable cost per processed email.

### 7. Security, privacy & compliance

* **Why:** Email content is sensitive; compliance required (GDPR, CCPA).
* **How:** Encrypt data at rest, TLS in transit, redact PII before sending to third-party APIs, retention policies, deletion endpoints, RBAC & OAuth2/JWT, secure secret storage (Vault/Secrets Manager).
* **Success metrics:** audit logs, privacy compliance checklists satisfied, passed security reviews.
